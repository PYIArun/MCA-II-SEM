Sure! Here is a summarized guide to install and run the `matplotlib-cpp` library from the GitHub repository you provided.

### 1. **Dependencies Required:**

- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **NumPy** (version < 2)
- **matplotlib** (Python library)
- **C++ Compiler** (`g++`)
- **Python Development Libraries**
  - For Fedora: `python3-devel`
- **matplotlib-cpp** library files (from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp))

### 2. **Steps to Install Dependencies:**

#### A. **Install Python and Necessary Libraries:**

- Install Python 3 if not already installed (check with `python3 --version`).
- Install NumPy (version < 2):
  ```bash
  pip install "numpy<2"
  ```
- Install `matplotlib` for Python:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

#### B. **Install Development Tools:**

- Install the Python development header files (e.g., `python3-devel` on Fedora):
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3-devel
  ```
  
- Install C++ build tools (`g++`):
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install gcc-c++
  ```

#### C. **Install matplotlib-cpp:**

1. **Download `matplotlib-cpp` from GitHub:**
   - Go to the [matplotlib-cpp GitHub repository](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp).
   - Download the ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory, for example, `/home/arun/matplotlibcpp`.

2. **Set Up Your C++ Project:**

- Make sure your C++ project includes the path to `matplotlibcpp.h` header file and links to the correct Python version.

#### D. **Compilation:**

- For compiling your C++ code with `matplotlibcpp`, use the following `g++` command:
  
  ```bash
  g++ your_program.cpp -o your_program -I/path/to/matplotlibcpp -I/usr/include/python3.x -lpython3.x
  ```

- Replace `/path/to/matplotlibcpp` with the actual path where you extracted `matplotlib-cpp`.

  - **For example:**
    ```bash
    g++ test.cpp -o test -I/home/arun/matplotlibcpp -I/usr/include/python3.13 -lpython3.13
    ```

- Run the compiled program:
  ```bash
  ./test
  ```

#### E. **Fixing NumPy Import Errors:**

If you encounter issues related to NumPy versions (like `ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import`), you may need to ensure that your Python environment is using compatible versions.

To ensure the right versions of NumPy and other dependencies, you can:

1. **Upgrade/reinstall the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade numpy
   pip install --upgrade matplotlib
   ```

2. **Downgrade NumPy to a version that works with `matplotlib-cpp`:**
   ```bash
   pip install "numpy<2"
   ```

#### F. **Ensure Correct Python Version:**

Make sure that the Python version used to install dependencies (such as NumPy) is the same version that `matplotlib-cpp` links to. If necessary, adjust the Python version in your compile command (`-I/usr/include/python3.x` and `-lpython3.x`).

---

### 3. **Final Steps:**

Once the dependencies are installed and your project is properly set up, you can compile and run your C++ code, which should successfully plot graphs using `matplotlib-cpp` as long as Python, NumPy, and matplotlib are correctly configured.

If any issues arise during setup or runtime, please let me know!

You're right! I missed mentioning the **warnings** that might arise while compiling and running `matplotlib-cpp` in the earlier response. Here's an update to address them:

### 4. **Warnings During Compilation and Execution**

While compiling and running `matplotlib-cpp`, you might encounter some warnings related to **deprecated Python functions**. These warnings are not critical, but it's helpful to know what they mean and how to handle them.

#### A. **Deprecated Functions Warnings:**

While compiling, you might see warnings like:

```bash
warning: ‘void Py_SetProgramName(const wchar_t*)’ is deprecated
warning: ‘void PySys_SetArgv(int, wchar_t**)’ is deprecated
```

These warnings are generated because the `matplotlib-cpp` library uses older Python API functions that have been marked as deprecated in recent versions of Python (Python 3.11 and later). These functions may be removed in future Python versions.

**How to handle this:**
- These warnings won't break the program, but they can clutter your output. If you want to suppress these warnings, you can use the `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` flag while compiling:
  
  ```bash
  g++ test.cpp -o test -I/home/arun/matplotlibcpp -I/usr/include/python3.13 -lpython3.13 -Wno-deprecated-declarations
  ```

#### B. **NumPy Version Incompatibility:**

When running the program, you may encounter errors or warnings like:

```bash
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.x
ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
```

This happens when there's a **version mismatch** between the Python packages used to compile the C++ code and the installed NumPy version. `matplotlib-cpp` is compiled against an older version of NumPy, and it may not be compatible with the new version (2.x) of NumPy.

**How to handle this:**
1. **Downgrade NumPy to an earlier version** (before 2.x), which should resolve the issue:
   
   ```bash
   pip install "numpy<2"
   ```

2. If you still encounter errors, try upgrading or reinstalling the relevant Python packages to ensure that NumPy and matplotlib are compatible:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade numpy
   pip install --upgrade matplotlib
   ```

3. **If your code still fails to run**, ensure that the Python version used by your C++ code matches the version where NumPy is installed.

#### C. **Runtime Errors (Core Dump / Segmentation Fault)**

You may sometimes encounter **segmentation faults** or **core dumps** when trying to run the compiled C++ program if there are issues with the Python environment, like missing Python packages or wrong library paths.

- **How to handle this:**
  - Ensure that the `matplotlibcpp.h` header file is properly linked with the Python libraries.
  - Check that your system Python and `matplotlib-cpp` are properly configured with compatible versions of Python, NumPy, and matplotlib.

---

### Final Notes:
- **Warnings during compilation** are common and can generally be ignored if they are not causing runtime crashes.
- **NumPy version mismatches** can cause runtime errors. Downgrading NumPy to version `<2` is the simplest fix.
- **Core dumps or segmentation faults** typically indicate an issue with the environment setup, such as incompatible versions of Python, libraries, or incorrect paths.

Once you address these issues, the program should work as expected! Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific warning or error.
